# Rastrigin Metaheuristic Optimization

This project focuses on solving the **Rastrigin optimization problem**, a highly multimodal benchmark function, using **local and metaheuristic search algorithms**.

The main goal is to demonstrate how optimization algorithms can escape local minima and converge toward the global optimum through iterative search and visualization.

## Problem Description

The Rastrigin function is a standard benchmark in optimization, known for its large number of local minima.  
Finding its **global minimum** is a challenging task for classical optimization methods.

In this project, we approach the problem from an **Artificial Intelligence search perspective**, aligning with concepts such as:
- State space
- Cost function
- Local search
- Metaheuristic strategies

## Objectives

- Formulate the Rastrigin optimization problem as a search problem
- Implement local and metaheuristic search algorithms
- Visualize the optimization process at each iteration
- Analyze convergence behavior
